# Running The Game
To run the game you will need to run an instane of *server.py* on one machine. Then you can run instances of *run.py* on other machines to connect.

You will need to change the **server** address in both *server.py* and *network.py* to be the IPV4 address of your machine or the server ips you'll be using.
