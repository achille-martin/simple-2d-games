# Description
Simple 2D pygame.
This is the start of a python game project.

# Running The Game
To run the game you will need to run an instane of *server.py* on one machine. Then you can run instances of *run.py* on other machines to connect.

You need to change the **server** address in both *server.py* and *network.py* to be the IPV4 address of your machine or the server ips you are using.

# TODO List

| Task  | State  |
|:-----:|:------:|
| Improve python socket connection (security, reliability, speed) | Not started |
| Improve data communication between clients and server (security, reliability, speed). Study the use of pickle and equivalent object serialisation tools | Not started |
| Improve the robustness of the simple 2D square movement game for 2 players | Not started |
| Implement the simple 2D square movement game for N players (add names to the squares for instance to differentiate them) | Not started |
